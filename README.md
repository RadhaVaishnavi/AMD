One particular use of machine and deep learning is classification. In this thesis we 
propose a novel classification model based on deep learning that will be able to classify and
identify different retinal diseases at early stages with high accuracy that outperform the state
of the art approaches, previous works and the diagnosis of experts in ophthalmology. Vision
and eye health are one the most crucial things in human life, it needs to be preserved to maintain
life of the individuals. Eye diseases such as CNV, DRUSEN, AMD, DME are mainly caused
due to the damages of the retina, and since it is damaged, and diagnosed at late stages, there is
almost no chance to reverse vision and cure it, which means that the patient will loose the
vision ability partially, and may be entirely. We propose here three deep convolutional neural
networks architectures and tuned three pretrained models that have been trained on large
dataset such as Inception, VGG-16 and ResNET. In order to evaluate our model we have
compared the diagnosis of 7 experts with the performence of our model. Our proposed model
outperformed the diagnosis of 6 out of 7 experts also the previous published works using the
same data, where we obtained an accuracy up to 99.27%.
